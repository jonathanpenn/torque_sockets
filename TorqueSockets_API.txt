Implementors should be aware that this specification is not stable. Implementors who are not taking part in the discussions are likely to find the specification changing out from under them in incompatible ways. Vendors interested in implementing this specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage should join the aforementioned mailing lists (once they truly are mentioned afore) and take part in the discussions.

1 Introduction
--------------
To enable Web applications (specifically real-time multiplayer client/server and peer-to-peer games, communication tools) to maintain bidirectional, efficient real-time communications with server-side processes and introduced-host processes, this specification introduces the TorqueSocket interface.

The high level goals of the TorqueSocket interface are:

* minimal footprint, API attack surface
	- intended to run in trusted code
* packet-based protocol to match underlying (UDP) transport
	- real-time protocols take varied approaches to data guarantee, fragmentation, priority
	- API should aim for "least-common (yet useful) denominator"
	- app-determined policy for send frequency and throughput
* connection handshake-based, prevent raw access to underlying network
	- Protocol should fit within browser security model
	- enable encryption and data validation
* low per-packet overhead
	- maximize bandwidth utilization for application
	- intended to be at the bottom layer of app-defined protocol stack

Specifically, the handshake negotiation goals include:

2 phase connect
client-puzzle challenge response for improved DOS protection
replicate "same origin" policies for requests to other hosts
enable peer host connection introduction (peer-to-peer or multi-server)
key exchange, public key validation option by web app code

Connection packet protocol:

Low per-packet protocol overhead (min-target 4 bytes/packet)
Variable-width packet window protocol (currently implemented as constants)
Packet delivery status notification (unreliable delivery, reliable notification)
Duplicate, out-of-order packet rejection
Variable-length packet signature (prototype implements as SHA-256, variable byte width recorded) 
Symmetric key encryption (prototype implements as 128-bit AES)

This interface does not allow for raw access to the underlying network.

	set_key_pair(in DOMString public_private_key);

	attribute Function on_connect_request(in int pending_connection, in DOMString public_key, in DOMString connect_data);
	attribute Function on_established(in int connection_id);
	attribute Function on_close(in int connection_id, in DOMString reason);

	attribute Function on_packet_delivery_notify(in int connection_id, in int sent_packet_sequence, in bool delivery_successful);
};

The TorqueSocket constructor opens a local UDP socket for communication through the interface.

The set_key_pair(public_private_key) method sets the public/private key pair for this client.  TorqueSocket uses the host's key size for key exchange, so if an initiator's key is not the same size as the host (can be checked on challenge response), the initiator will generate a new key pair for that connection.

The connect(URL, connect_data, protocol_settings) method initiates connection with a remote host using the TorqueSocket connection protocol.  The URL resolves to the remote host address/port, connect_data is optional data the host needs to validate on connection (for example, this could be a connection token passed into the page, or login data).  connect_data will be encrypted by the shared secret generated from the public key exchange.  The protocol_settings field specifies particular protocol settings, including packet window width and signature byte count.

The second path for connection creation in TorqueSocket is by introduction.  Two TorqueSocket connected to a third "introducer" TorqueSocket can be introduced such that they have a direct connection between them.  This is accomplished by each party in the introduction (the initiator, the host and the introducer) calling either (in the case of initiator/host) connect_introduced(introducer, remote_client_connection_id, is_host, connect_data_or_challenge_response, protocol_settings) or introduce(initiator_connection, host_connection).  The introduction method allows clients connecting from behind certain NAT devices to learn the public address/port of the other party.

The connect process is two-phase -- the first phase is called the "challenge" phase, where connection endpoints are verified and the host of the connection can defend against certain forms of DoS attack.  The second phase is called the "connect" phase.

In the challenge phase, the initiator will receive a challenge response from the host via the on_challenge_response Function attribute.  If the challenge response is satisfactory -- the initiator can validate the public key and/or challenge_response_data -- the initiator should next call accept_challenge(pending_connection) with the connection id token or close(connection_id, reason_data) if it is not.

In the connect phase, the host will receive a connection request via the on_connect_request(pending_connection, public_key, connect_data) Function attribute.  If the connect request is satisfactory, the host should call accept_connection(pending_connection) or close(pending_connection, reason) if not.

Once TorqueSocket detects that the initiator and host have both completed the handshake, it issues a call to on_established(connection_id).  At this point, the instance can send data packets with a call to send_to(connection_id, packet_data), which will return the sequence number of the sent packet or a failure code if the OS-level send fails or if the packet window is full.  When the delivery status of a given packet send is detected, the TorqueSocket will issue a call to on_packet_delivery_notify(connection_id, sent_packet_sequence, delivery_successful).  Packets and delivery notifications are guaranteed to be delivered in order.

4 Detailed connection handshake overview
----------------------------------------
torque_sockets does a two phase connect handshake to prevent a several types of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.

The connection initiator starts the connection by sending a unique random nonce (number, used once) value to the host as part of the connect_challenge_request packet.

initiator->host: connect_challenge_request(initiator_nonce)

The host responds to the connect_challenge_request with a "Client Puzzle" that has the property that verifying a solution to the puzzle is computationally simple, but can be of a specified computational, brute-force difficulty to compute the solution itself.  The client puzzle is of the form: secureHash(Ic, initiator_nonce, host_nonce, X) = Y >> k, where Ic is the identity of the client, and X is a value computed by the client such that the high k bits of the value y are all zero.  The client identity is computed by the server as a partial hash of the client's IP address and port and some random data on the host.  The response contains the host's current nonce, the initiator nonce, k, the host's public key and any data set via set_challenge_response_data

host->initiator: connect_challenge_response(initiator_nonce, host_nonce, k, host_public_key, host_challenge_response_data)

The initiator, upon receipt of the connect_challenge_response, validates the packet sent by the host and computes a solution to the puzzle the host sent.  The initiator generates a shared secret from the initiator's key pair and the host's public key.  The initiator response to the host consists of:

initiator->host: connect_request(initiator_nonce, host_nonce, X, initiator_public_key, shared_secret(key1, sequence1, connect_request_data))

The host then can validation the solution to the puzzle the initiator submitted, along with the client identity (Ic).  Until this point the host has allocated no memory for the initiator and has verified that the initiator is sending from a valid IP address, and that the initiator has done some amount of work to prove its willingness to start a connection.  As the host load increases, the host may choose to increase the difficulty (k) of the client puzzles it issues, thereby making a CPU/connection resource depletion DoS attack successively more difficult to launch.

If the server accepts the connection, it sends a connect accept packet that is encrypted and hashed using the shared secret.  The contents of the packet are another sequence number (sequence2) and another key (key2).  The sequence numbers are the initial send and receive sequence numbers for the torque_connection protocol, and the key2 value becomes the IV of the symmetric cipher.  The connection_accept_data is also sent and encrypted in this channel.

Connections using the secure key exchange are still vulnerable to Man-in-the-middle attacks.  Using a key signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA), makes the communications channel as securely trusted as the trust in the CA.  This could be implemented by the host sending its certificate and a signature of the public key down in the challenge_response_data

Introduced Connection handshaking: (not implemented yet)

torque_socket can also facilitate introduced connections.  Introduced connections are necessary when both parties to the connection are behind firewalls or NAT routers, or don't want to accept anonymous connections from the network.  Suppose there are two processes, initiator and host that want to establish a direct connection and that those two processes are connected to the same third party introducer.  All three parties can simultaneously initiate an introduced connection by calling the appropriate methods on their torque_socket instances.  The protocol works as follows:

initiator/host->introducer: request_introduction(remote_connection_id, shared_secret(initiator/host _nonce))

introducer->initiator/host: introduction_response( shared_secret( remote_public_addresses, introduced_connection_shared_secret, remote_nonce ) )

The remote public addresses are the public (NAT'd) address of the hosts from the perspective of the introducer, as well as the IP addresses each client detects for itself including local network address and external addresses as determined from the router by UPnP and/or Bonjour APIs (not implemented yet!).

Once the initiator and host receive introduction_responses, they being sending "punch" packets to the known possible addresses of each other.  The punch packet I sends enables the punch packet H sends to be delivered through the router or firewall since it will appear as though it is a service response to I's initial packet, and vice versa.

Upon receipt of the punch packet by the host of the connection, the initiator engages the normal connection process (challenge request/response, connect request/response).  If the host of the introduced connection gets challenge request it stops sending punch packets to the potential addresses.
